                The food serviece industry was going through a hard time last year

                When the Coronavirus began spreading
                earlier last year, a large number of employees working in the food serviece industry lost their jobs
                because of lockdown
                policy, especially the social distancing order.

                But it seems people are likely to come back to normal from this year, as vaccines are rolling out
                quickly.

                I'm very curious to see the trend of how the food serviece industry from the time before the pandemic to
                the summer this year. What's more, I think it will be more interesting to have trends of each state in
                the U.S..

                So I found a good and realiable <a
                    href="https://restaurant.org/downloads/pdfs/research/state-employment-trends-march-2021.pdf">dataset</a>
                from National Restaurant Association. The data shows job numbers in eating and drinking places by state
                from Feb 2020 to June 2021, which I planed to analyze it in R so I'm able to make multiple charts of
                each state's trend. This is my <a
                    href="https://github.com/baidiwang/restaurants_multiple_charts/blob/main/R_code.R">code in R</a>.

            <p class="g-copy">
                From the chart I made above, the employment trend in the food service industry of each state bounced
                back to, or closer to the pre-pandemic level. It is great news illustrating the food service industry is
                warming up. However, the data I found was only updated until June this year. As the Delta varient has
                spread quickly since last month, it is still unknown if the food service industry is back to normal in
                the near future.
